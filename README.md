# BabyRoll Project README

Welcome to BabyRoll, an educational initiative brought to you by CyberAcademy and Oxorio.

## Project Overview

ZK rollup is a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum and other blockchain platforms. It allows multiple transactions to be bundled together off-chain, reducing the load on the main chain and improving scalability and transaction throughput. BabyRoll provides a beginner-friendly environment to understand the fundamental concepts behind ZK rollup and its implementation using Circom.

## How to Use

To get started with the BabyRoll project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:oxor-io/circom_workshop.git
   cd circom_workshop
   ```

2. **Explore the Code:**
   Familiarize yourself with the project structure and existing codebase.

3. **Completing Homework Tasks:**
   The project includes several TODO tasks to enhance your understanding and skills. Your homework assignments are as follows:

   - **Prevent Replay Attack:**
     Implement a solution to prevent replay attacks by adding a nonce to transactions.

   - **Overflow Check:**
     Add an overflow check for the recipient's balance to prevent unintended behavior.

   - **Write Verifier Smart Contract:**
     Write a verifier smart contract to validate the correctness of the ZK rollup proofs.

   - **Optional: MultyTx Rollup Support:**
     If you are feeling adventurous, explore adding support for processing multiple transactions (MultyTx rollup). This task is optional but highly encouraged for a more comprehensive learning experience.
